# Contribute

If you're interested in adding features, reporting/fixing bugs, or just discussing the future of freactal, this is the place to start.  Please feel free to reach out if you have questions or comments by opening an [issue](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/freactal/issues).


## Adding new features

If there's a feature you'd like to see that isn't already in-progress or documented, there are two ways you can go about it:

- open an issue for discussion; or
- fork and submit a PR.

Either way is fine, so long as you remember your PR may not be accepted as-is or at all.  If a feature request is reasonable, though, it'll most likely be included one way or another.

Some other things to remember:

- Please respect the project layout and hierarchy, to keep things organized.
- All code is linted.  Outside of that, please try to conform to the code style and idioms that are used throughout the project.
- Include descriptions for issues and PRs.
- Please comply with the project's [code of conduct](./COC.md).

I'm busy and travel sometimes for work - so if I don't respond immediately, please be patient.  I promise to reply!

## Commit message structure

Please follow the following commit message structure when submitting your pull request:

    TYPE: Short commit message

    Detailed
    commit
    info

For the value of **`TYPE`**, please use one of **`Feature`**, **`Enhancement`**, or **`Fix`**.

This is required in order to help us automate tasks such as changelog generation.


# Bugs

If you encounter a bug, please check for an open issue that already captures the problem you've run into.  If it doesn't exist yet, create it!

Please include as much information as possible, including:

- A full repro, if possible.
- The versions of the packages that you're using.
- The browser or environment where the issue occurs.
- Any error messages or debug output that seems relevant.

If you're interested in tackling a bug, please say so.


# Documentation

If you make changes, please remember to update the documentation to reflect the new behavior.

# Publishing

All changes are published automatically whenever a pull request is merged.  As part of the PR process, you will be asked to provide the information necessary to make that happen.
